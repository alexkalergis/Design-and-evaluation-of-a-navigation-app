# Design-evaluation-of-a-navigation-app
The purpose of this project is the design of the navigation application myNavigation based on the PACT model. The design process involves analyzing the potential users of the application, identifying usage scenarios, and reproducing patterns upon which the creation of the application will be based. In order to proceed with the design, we were first required to evaluate an existing navigation application (Komoot app) with the help of users. The results we obtained were used to create the best possible version of the application, avoiding any design mistakes we identified. Finally, we proceeded with the design of the myNavigation application and its evaluation compared to the Komoot application.

The model we utilized during the project is the Hix-Hartson star model. At each stage of the design, we evaluated the results, based on which we designed another part of the application. We repeated this process, returning to each stage until we reached a satisfactory final result.
