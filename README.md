## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to design the myNavigation application using the PACT model. The design process entails a comprehensive analysis of potential users, identification of usage scenarios, and the creation of patterns to guide the application's development. 

## Design Process:

- **User Analysis and Scenario Identification:** We began by analyzing the potential users of the application and identifying various usage scenarios. 

- **Evaluation of Existing Application:** To inform our design, we evaluated the existing Komoot navigation application with the help of real users. The insights gained from this evaluation helped us identify and avoid potential design flaws.

- **Application Development:** Using the feedback from the Komoot app evaluation, we developed the initial version of myNavigation, aiming to incorporate the best practices and avoid identified pitfalls.

## Iterative Design and Evaluation:

We employed the Hix-Hartson star model throughout the project. This iterative process involved:

- **Stage-wise Evaluation:** At each design stage, we meticulously evaluated the results and made necessary adjustments.
  
- **Refinement:** We continually refined each aspect of the application, returning to previous stages as needed, until we achieved a satisfactory final product.

## Final Outcome:

The iterative process and thorough evaluation allowed us to design a user-centered, efficient, and robust navigation application. The final version of myNavigation was compared against the Komoot app to ensure it met our high standards and addressed user needs effectively.
